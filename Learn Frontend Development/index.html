      <h1>Learn Front End Web Development</h1>
      <p>Front-end development begins with the three foundational pillars of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the essential structure of a webpage, while CSS brings it to life with styling and design. JavaScript then adds dynamic behavior and interactivity, making the page responsive and engaging. Mastering these three is the crucial first step on your journey.</p>

        <h2>Learn HTML</h2>
        <p>Learning HTML is the first step in front-end web development. It's the language that gives your web page its fundamental structure, using a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website. Without it, there would be no content to display. Mastering HTML means you'll be able to organize your content logically, making your page accessible and easy for both users and search engines to understand.</p>

        <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
        <p>Once you have the structure in place, CSS is what makes it look good. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language for styling a webpage. It's used to control colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. CSS allows you to transform a plain HTML page into a visually appealing and branded experience. You can use it to create responsive designs that look great on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), you can manage the look and feel of your website more efficiently.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Learn JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Finally, JavaScript brings your website to life by adding interactivity. While HTML provides the structure and CSS handles the appearance, JavaScript allows you to create dynamic and responsive features. This includes everything from simple animations and form validation to complex user interfaces and single-page applications. JavaScript is the engine that enables user engagement, allowing a website to react to clicks, keystrokes, and other user actions. By mastering JavaScript, you can build powerful and engaging web experiences that are more than just static documents.</p>
